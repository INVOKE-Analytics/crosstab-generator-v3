## What is Crosstab?

Crosstab is a two- (or more) dimensional table that is usually used in data analysis to uncover more granular insights from the data we gathered from the survey. It makes use of a statistical analysis known as Cross Tabulation analysis (or also known as Contingency Table analysis) to quantitatively evaluate the correlation between multiple variables. A typical cross-tabulation table compares two hypothetical variables, which are usually the survey question and the respondents' demographic (it can be either ethnicity, age group, gender, etc). 

## About the Project

This project aims to expedite our crosstab generation process from long minutes of manual labour work using Excel pivot table to just a mere couple of seconds. With this crosstab generator, one just need to upload the weighted data file, wait for a couple of seconds and boom - the crosstab is set for you! By automating the crosstab generation process, we hope to divert the time and energy that are previously used for crosstab to other purposes, so that we can improve our overall survey work.

### Built With

[![Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://invoke-analytics-crosstabs-prod-generator-cs1fpd.streamlitapp.com/)

## Getting Started

If you are working on this project, simply follow the guide below.

### Prerequisites

1. Github Account
2. Git Bash
3. Visual Studio Code
4. Streamlit Cloud

### Installations

1. **Github Account** <br />
   If you are reading this document, that means you already have a Github account. Congratss!! :partying_face::tada: But if you simple want to create a new account,      click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account) for more information about it.
   
2. **Git Bash** <br />
   If you have never heard of it before, Git Bash is a source control management system for Windows that allows users to type Git commands (such as git clone and git      commit) which we will use a lot in this project. To install it, download the Git Bash setup from the official website: https://git-scm.com/

3. **Visual Studio Code** <br />
   This is the suggested IDE for this project. The reason for this is because Visual Studio Code works seamlessly with Git since there is a Git Bash extension that you    can easily install in it. You can go to this [page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to download Visual Studio Code that matches your operating system. 
   
4. **Streamlit Cloud** <br />
   There are a lot of public cloud platforms out there that you can use to deploy your Streamlit app. However, in this project, we use Streamlit Cloud since it is free 
   and easy to manage. You need to create a Streamlit Cloud account in order to deploy a new Streamlit app as well as to monitor other Streamlit apps in our existing 
   Invoke Analytics repositories. To create an account, simply sign up once you click this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
