## What is Crosstab?

Crosstab is a two- (or more) dimensional table that is usually used in data analysis to uncover more granular insights from the data we gathered from the survey. It makes use of a statistical analysis known as Cross Tabulation analysis (or also known as Contingency Table analysis) to quantitatively evaluate the correlation between multiple variables. A typical cross-tabulation table compares two hypothetical variables, which are usually the survey question and the respondents' demographic (it can be either ethnicity, age group, gender, etc). 

## About the Project

This project aims to expedite our crosstab generation process from long minutes of manual labour work using Excel pivot table to just a mere couple of seconds. With this crosstab generator, one just need to upload the weighted data file, wait for a couple of seconds and boom - the crosstab is set for you! By automating the crosstab generation process, we hope to divert the time and energy that are previously used for crosstab to other purposes, so that we can improve our overall survey work.

On that note, since this is the second version and not the final product, there are a couple of things that you should take note of.
